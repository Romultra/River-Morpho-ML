## Install dependencies

<code>braided.yml</code> is the environment file with all dependencies, needed to run the notebooks.

To activate the environment follow these steps:

- make sure to have the file <code>braided.yml</code> in your system (for Windows users, store it in <code>C:\Windows\System32</code>);
- open the anaconda prompt;
- run <code>conda env create -f braided.yml</code>;
- verify that the environment is correctly installed by running <code>conda env list</code> and checking the environment exists;
- activate the environment by running <code>conda activate braided</code>;
- deactivate the environment by running <code>conda deactivate</code>;
